## Other features

### Local data storage

All data are stored locally without the user's need to provide their information. Data storage uses the browser's `localStorage` feature, which means these data will be wiped if the browser's data is cleared.

### Dark mode

Styling in **Wardi** is provided by Bootstrap. By default, the site is shown in light mode but users have the option to view the site in dark mode should they want.
